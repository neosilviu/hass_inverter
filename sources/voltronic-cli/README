skymax
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was forked from manio/skymax-demo on git since it allows me to query my
own Axpert solar inverter. A company in Taiwan called Voltronic sells a hardware plat-
form used in many different brands of inverter. My brand just happens to be one of
those Voltronic clones so all the same commands apply.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
compilation / running
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(You will need cmake, make and gcc already installed.  Use apt-get to get them)

Sample build/compilation procedure:
$ git clone https://github.com/nrm21/skymax-demo
$ cd skymax-demo
$ mkdir out
$ cd out
$ cmake ..
$ make

Then you need to get the real hidraw device name (probably hidraw0):
$ dmesg | grep hidraw

and then run the program like this (assuming it is located in '/opt/skymax/out' dir):
$ /opt/skymax/out/skymax

The program will run once, it will spit out values it receives from the inverter in
JSON format and exits.  It was intended to be run by telegraf using the exec plugin
every 15 seconds, and that output data will be imported into an InfluxDB instance
where it can be easily graphed by grafana (or some other "TIG or TICK stack"-like
software suite).

The program can also be made to send raw commands to the inverter if you choose:
$ /opt/skymax/out/skymax -r POP00   # set utility output mode
$ /opt/skymax/out/skymax -r POP02   # set SBU output mode
$ /opt/skymax/out/skymax -r PCP00   # set utility charging mode
$ /opt/skymax/out/skymax -r PCP03   # set solar only charging mode
etc...

These commands can of course be scripted and put into a cron job to run them at a
certain time of day/week as well (say, every morning at 8am switch to solar charging
mode only and SBU output mode).

See this protocol manual for more commands that can be sent:
